Welcome to my Codsoft Internship repository! 

Here, I've showcased my skills in web development through the creation of three distinct tasks: a landing page, a calculator, and a portfolio.Each task is crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate a combination of creativity and functionality.
